      My name is Theary and I am currently a student at <a href="www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>. Over the past few years, I have worked diligently to develop experience and confidence while preparing for a career in the tech industry. My backgroud in customer and clinical services as well as management for over eight years, instilled my mindful but competitive approach. My work responsibilites envelop me in a diverse cultural and multidiscipline environment requiring precision, organixation and a broad range of communication abilities with the team.
