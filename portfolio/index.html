          <h1>Theary Im</h1>
          <p>My name is Theary and I am currently a student at <a href="www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a>. The first week goes by really <strong>FAST!</strong> I am amazed of how much information we've covered. I am feeling pretty good about Command Line and Git but still need more practice on the concept of Branching and Merging.

      <h4>My background</h4>
        <p>
          Over the past eight years, I have been in customer and clinical services as well as management. My work responsibilites envelop me in a diverse cultural and multidiscipline environment requiring precision, organization and a broad range of communication abilities with the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a daily basis, the ability to employ consistent and efficient method of informing customer, supporting my team and providing direction is critical to our success as whole. I greatly enjoy the challenges, the quick pace and making lasting, effective contribution to the community. My believe for goal-driven and data driven approach has contributed to our team success at <a href="https://www.mednax.com/practice/obstetrix-medical-group-issaquah/">Obsterix Medical Group</a>, where we increase our patient satifaction by 30% and our revenue by 18% (accroding to our Cognos Report) in the last 12 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in personal growth especially growth mindset. I believe that what I learn from <a href="www.epicodus.com">Epicodus</a> will allow me to expand upon these abilities.
