          <p>My name is Theary and I am currently a student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>. The first week goes by really <strong>FAST!</strong> I am amazed at how much information we've covered. I am feeling pretty good about the Command-Line and Git but still need more practice with the concepts of branching and merging.
